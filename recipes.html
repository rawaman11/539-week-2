            <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

                <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings. <br>
                    They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

                    <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until well combined. Add the melted chocolate and mix until chocolate is well combined.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chunks.</li>

                    <li>Bake cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until cookies are set, but still soft in the center. Don't overbake. Remove from oven and let sit on baking sheet for 3 minutes. Move to a cooling rack and cool completely.</li>
